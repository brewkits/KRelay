 * iOS implementations for KRelay demo.

 * NOTE: iOS demo is temporarily simplified due to framework export configuration.
 * The Android demo (with Voyager integration) is fully functional and demonstrates
 * all KRelay features.
 *
 * To see the complete demo:
 * - Run on Android (recommended)
 * - Or configure iOS framework exports for krelay.samples protocols
 *
 * The core KRelay library works perfectly on iOS - this is just a demo app limitation.
